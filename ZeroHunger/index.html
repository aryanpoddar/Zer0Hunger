            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px"> We all must have probably heard of zero-hunger right? Or if we didn’t then we
                would
                probably know it by the meaning. But we might not have heard of zero hunger, our goal is to achieve zero
                hunger by 2030, why you may say? Zero hunger is something all of us have known perhaps, but we must
                already know that there are undernourished people who work for hours in the sun trying to earn money for
                a decent living for their family. So, we must help them to have a good life and to get equal amount of
                food. But first we must know about zero hunger and get an idea, read through this and you will know
                everything about it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro2">
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Why is Zero Hunger important</h1>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">From avoiding and working towards poverty and hunger, we could stop climate
                change and that would help to bring down the high level of pollution in the atmosphere. Without
                spreading and achieving zero hunger first, we would not be able have proper nutrients, stop climate
                change and eventually we would be living in a world with no resources.
                Fights and arguments happen regularly for undernourished people due to the slow food production and the
                disrupt farming. Tons of people are often sent back or is forced to flee their homes and find themselves
                undernourished because of the access and the diverse amount of food given to each. Most of the countries
                go hungry, starving for food for hours, it mostly happens to developing or advanced countries which
                cause various conflicts food. Global hunger is the key point for all the causes of disruption of
                countries e.g. wars, arguments etc. It is very natural for people or citizens to be arguing over the
                amount of food, because it is impossible to find some anyway. So, if we help fight Global hunger and
                achieve zero hunger, surely we can stop all wars and bring peace to the world.
                Zero hunger is a guilt that we all know about, but we really don’t know the reason why it is important.
                - It is to achieve food security.
                - improved nutrition so that all the people on Earth would be healthy and living in a good environment,
                this is important since every minute of our lives, while we are eating, the children and people die one
                by one every minute, right now this year more than 3,420,162 people died are right now, promote
                sustainable agriculture.
                - Hunger is the leading cause of death in the world. Our planet has provided us with tremendous
                resources, but unequal access and inefficient handling leaves millions of people malnourished, none of
                us know what it is like to actually understand what they are going through. Every minute of their lives
                are painful and sad.

            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">WHY DOES OUR BODY NEED NUTRIENTS?</h1>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Our body need nutrients as they provide material for growth and repair, energy
                to keep our cells and
                vital elements to maintain the chemical reaction in our cells.
                The body requires many different vitamins and minerals that are crucial for both body development and
                preventing disease. These vitamins and minerals are often referred to as micronutrients. They aren’t
                produced naturally in the body, so you have to get them from your diet. So if you don’t have a balanced
                diet it may cause deficiency diseases. Here are few examples of deficiency diseases:
                <br>
                -Vitamin A - Night blindness
                <br>
                -Vitamin C- Scurvy, Muscle Weakness, Bleeding gums
                <br>
                -Vitamin D- Rickets & Osteoporosis
                <br>
                -Calcium- Muscle cramps & brittle bones
                <br>
                -Iron- Anaemia
                <br>
                -Fibre- Suffers from Constipation

            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">What is good nutrition?
                Good nutrition is to have an equal diet of everything, meaning proteins, carbohydrates etc.
                How is good nutrition linked to zero hunger?
                For example, amyloidosis is a disease for consuming too much proteins, rarely some undernourished people
                may have access to only proteins, but they are missing out on the other important food. All must have a
                proper healthy diet consuming all the nutrients, since it is especially important.

            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;"> SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</h1>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">What is sustainable agriculture?
                Sustainable agriculture is to have a sustainable and productive way of farming.

                How is sustainable agriculture linked with Zero hunger?
                We have unlimited ways to find resources e.g. sea, land, forests, and fields, they are all-natural
                resources we could use without damaging the planet. It is sustainable because food production must
                cooperate because then we will not have any more resources.
                If done right, agriculture, forestry and fisheries can provide nutritious food for all and generate
                decent incomes, while supporting people-centred rural development and protecting the environment.

            <h1 style="font-size: 45px;">HOW IS HUNGER AFFECTING CHILDREN?</h1>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Well as you may know there is a cycle that leads a child to a bad state and
                condition. When a women is in
                bad state without food in site, they become malnourished and then they give birth to an undernourished
                child, this leads the child to a poor mental development as well as some diseases that are passed down.
                Afterwards, the children struggle to understand some things while studying that avoids them to have
                proper education and knowledge. This means when they grow up since the lack of education, they will not
                find a proper job, and the cycle will start again. As you see, Global hunger can have a huge impact on a
                child’s mental and physical health, so if we take the initiative to stand up and spread the message then
                they won’t have to live like this. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="b2">
            <h1 style="font-size: 45px;">WHY ARE CHILDREN MALNOURISHED?</h1><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">There are various forms on how they have malnutrition – stunting, wasting,
                underweight, minerals and
                vitamins. The reason of all of this is not their fault, they cannot find food and do not have access to
                it. Everyday adults across developing countries travel far and wide to feed their children a nutritious
                and healthy meal. Earth, gives us enough resources equally to feed everyone with a nutritious meal, but
                due to laws and the ‘higher hierarchy’ we have come across some unfair laws that could potentially
                affect the health and growth of a child’s mind and body.
                Every 821 million people, one in nine go to bed with an empty stomach left with nothing but starvation.
                In addition, one in three suffer from diseases like chronic malnutrition.
                Low height-for-age is known as stunting. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition,
                usually associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent
                illness, and/or inappropriate infant and young child feeding and care in early life. Stunting holds
                children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential.

            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Poverty eradication means for all countries to have a more strong and well
                economical growth as well as
                when the country is developing, they also must ensure and keep in mind that it is important and a
                necessity to let their citizens have a well maintained life style.
                The 2030 Agenda acknowledges that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme
                poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.
                Our hope and our goal is to reach this by 2030, this is guilt that we all know of, but don’t acknowledge
                how big of an impact it creates for our Earth and us, studying and researching isn’t all about zero
                hunger, we have to take actions.

        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align:center;">Every year, 17 million children and adults are born and are
            undernourished, 840 million live from chronic
            disease, most of the people who don’t get enough resources live in developing or advancing countries,
            therefore it leads to not have enough supply of resources for everyone. Only the higher hierarchy have
            access to food, water and other resources compared to the poor. Also, the most obvious reason is that they
            have only small farming communities, that means that the food production is not enough for everyone, also it
            is not equally divided or shared. Hunger leads to wars, natural disasters etc. So, we need to stop it, so
            share it on multiple media platforms, convince everyone to participate </p>
